# Unemployment in India Analysis Project
Unemployment prediction is the process of forecasting the number of people who are unemployed in a given economy. This can be done by using a variety of methods, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and economic indicators.
Statistical models are used to analyze historical data on unemployment and other economic factors in order to identify patterns and trends. Machine learning algorithms can be used to learn from historical data and make predictions about future unemployment levels.
