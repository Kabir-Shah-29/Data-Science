    "\n",
    "# Input Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The input layer represents the raw input data, such as an image.\n",
    "# It specifies the shape of the input data, including its dimensions (e.g., width, height, and number \n",
    "# of color channels).\n",
    "# Convolutional Layer (Conv2D):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convolutional layers are responsible for learning spatial hierarchies of features in the input data.\n",
    "# They slide small square-shaped filters (kernels) over the input data to perform element-wise \n",
    "# multiplication and aggregation.\n",
    "# The result is a set of feature maps that represent learned features in the input.\n",
    "# Typically, multiple convolutional layers are stacked to capture increasingly complex features.\n",
    "# Activation Function (e.g., ReLU):\n",
    "\n",
    "# After convolution, an activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is applied element-wise\n",
    "# to the feature maps.\n",
    "# ReLU introduces nonlinearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "# The most common activation function is ReLU, which replaces negative values with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pooling Layer (MaxPooling2D or AveragePooling2D):\n",
    "# Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.\n",
    "# They help reduce computation and overfitting by retaining the most important information.\n",
    "# Max pooling selects the maximum value in each pooling region, while average pooling computes the \n",
    "# average.\n",
    "# Pooling is applied independently to each feature map.\n",
    "# Batch Normalization Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Batch normalization normalizes the activations of each layer in the network.\n",
    "# It helps stabilize and accelerate training by mitigating the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.\n",
    "# Batch normalization can be applied before or after the activation function.\n",

    "# Dropout Layer:\n",
    "# Dropout layers randomly deactivate a fraction of neurons during training.\n",

    "# Flatten Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Before transitioning from convolutional layers to fully connected layers, a flatten layer is used.\n",
    "# It converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, which can be fed into a dense layer.\n",
    "# Dense Layer (Fully Connected Layer):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dense layers are traditional feedforward neural network layers.\n",
    "# They capture complex relationships between features and are used for classification or regression.\n",

    "# Output Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The output layer produces the final prediction or classification.\n",
    "# It may use different activation functions depending on the task (e.g., softmax for classification).\n",

    "# These layers work together to create a hierarchical representation of the input data, with early \n",
    "# layers learning low-level  features (e.g., edges and textures) and later layers capturing higher-\n",
    "# level features and semantic information. CNNs are especially effective in tasks like image \n",
