#Titanic Survival Prediction

 The Titanic survival project is a data science project that uses machine learning to predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic. The project uses a dataset of passenger information, including their age, sex, class, and fare, to train a model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.
